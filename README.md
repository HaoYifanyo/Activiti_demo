# Activiti_demo
The project is based on [Activiti](https://www.activiti.org/) 6.0. 
## Background
Activiti is an open-source engine designed to help businesses solve automation challenges in distributed, highly-scalable and cost effective infrastructures. 
The most important task of it is to provide flexible and customizable processes. With the necessary configuration, Activiti can determine the following two things:
* What is the process to go through (by bpmn file)
* Who is authorized to operate at a certain point (by [taskListener](#TaskListener))

In this project, I created some useful wrapper [methods](#Methods) to make it easier for other modules to operate the processes. 
The code has been used in large real software projects. I removed the parts of them that were associated with business code and improved them.

## Methods
### open

## TaskListener
